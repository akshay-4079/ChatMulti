# About

This is a simple application that I built to study sockets programming. It is a multi-threaded application that supports multiple clients and also supports broadcast and private messages

Be sure to change the IP and port to your preference before starting.

# Readme

Type Help in the Client Window to get a rundown on using the app.

To send a broadcast message simply type the message and hit enter.

To send a private message send the message after typing the client name and /,So to send a message to John you would type John/Your Message.

Type Exit to leave the message.

## Known Issues

Adding a client with the same name will result in the client being added with a generic name.

Closing the client without typing exit might cause the server to crash in some systems.
